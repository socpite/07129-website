                <h2>Qatar Living Data Breach (March 2024)</h2>
                
                <h3>What did the attackers break into</h3>
                <p>Hackers were able to break into Qatar Living's database, which contains 115,669 data lines. They were posted on a dark web forum, Breach Forums. Leaked information contains phone numbers, email addresses, images, users' role and permission on the platform.</p>
                
                <h3>How did the attackers break in to it</h3>
                <p>There were no report on the method of attacking, but most ElastiSearch database leaks are because of misconfigured or missing security setup. An unprotected ElastiSearch database would take only 8 hours to break in.</p>
                
                <h3>Who was impacted</h3>
                <p>People who were affected are exposed to phishing attacks, identity theft and scam calls. The breach destroyed the companies's reputation.</p>
                
                <h3>How was it investigated</h3>
                <p>The leak first caught attention when the stolen data was posted on Breach Forums. An investigation was conducted by iZoologic researchers on the data leaks, revealing the number of affected customer and the amount of data leaked. In response to the breach Qatar's National Cyber Security Agency have conducted national cyber drills aimed at testing the security measures of approximately 170 key organizations. This helps the organizations to prepare for attacks.</p>
