# What is the decision problem:

The decision problem is a computational problem where there is a Yes/No answer to each set of input. For example, the problem 'is x a prime' is a decision problem

# What does it mean for a decision problem to be decidable?

A decision problem is decidable if there is an algorithm that can answer the problem in a finite amount of time for all possible inputs.

# What is the class P? What is the class NP?

Class P is the class of problems where there exist a polynomial time algorithm to solve the problem. Class NP is the problems where there exist an algorithm to verify an answer in polynomial time but there is no way to find the answer quickly. NP stands for "nondeterministic polynomial time"

# What is the intuitive meaning of the “P versus NP” question?

The question is asking whether if a problem whose answer can be verified polynomial time can also be solved in polynomial time. It is asking whether all problems in class NP is in class P.

# If you resolve the P versus NP question, how much richer will you be?

At least one million dollar. More money can be offered if the answer to the question leads to significant advancement in practical technologies.
